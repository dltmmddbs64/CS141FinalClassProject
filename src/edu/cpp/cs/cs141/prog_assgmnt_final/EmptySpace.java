 *
 *  Text-based game in which the player is located on a 9x9 grid unable to see anything,
 *  but where the player is located. The objective is to find a briefcase located 
 *  within one of 9 rooms located throughout the grid. The caveat, there are 6 enemies
 *  located throughout the grid that can kill the player if the two meet. There are 3 power
 *  ups scattered across the board that will aid the player in finding the brief case: 
 *  additional bullet, radar, and invisibility. The additional bullet will refill the player's 
 *  one-shot gun in the event it was shot earlier. The radar power up will located the 
 *  briefcase and disclose the location to the player. Invincibility will make the player 
 *  immune to all enemy attacks up to five turns. Keep in mind, the player has no storage
 *  so none of the power ups can be stored for later use. The player has 3 lives before
 *  game over. A load and save option is available for convenience.
